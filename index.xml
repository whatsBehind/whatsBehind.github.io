      <description>Thread Interference Imagine you have an object that maintains a hit count for a website. If two threads increment the hit counter at the same time, they might read the same value, say 100. Both threads then increment it and set it back to the object. The result should be 102 hits, but because there was no synchronization, you only get 101 - one hit is lost. This is a simple example of a race condition.</description>

      <description>Understanding the lifecycle of a thread is crucial for effective thread management. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown:
NEW State:
When you create an instance of a Thread class (or a class that extends Thread), the thread is in the New state. At this point, the thread is not yet running. Example: Thread t = new Thread(); RUNNABLE State:
When you invoke the start() method, the thread moves to the RUNNABLE state. A thread in the RUNNABLE state is executing in the Java virtual machine but it may be waiting for other resources from the operating system such as processor.</description>

      <description>Main Lesson Java threads are crucial for executing multiple tasks concurrently in a program. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into this topic:
What is a Thread in Java? ðŸ§µ
In Java, a thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Think of it like a worker who performs a part of a larger task. Creating a Thread ðŸ’»
There are two ways to create a thread: By extending the Thread class. By implementing the Runnable interface.</description>

      <title>Reflection</title>

      <description>Introduction to Java Reflection Java Reflection is a powerful feature that allows runtime introspection of classes, objects, and their members. It enables Java programs to manipulate internal properties and methods of classes dynamically. Reflection is especially useful in scenarios where the program needs to interact with classes and objects whose properties are not known at compile time.
Class Object The heart of Java&amp;rsquo;s reflection mechanism. It&amp;rsquo;s an instance that represents classes and interfaces in a running Java application.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s CORS CORS is a mechanism to stop you from accessing resource in one origin from another origin. For example, there is an image img.jpg from origin images.com, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have CORS set properly, you can&amp;rsquo;t access the img.jpg from other origins like yourOrigin.com.
Why needs CORS CORS is mainly for security usage. Image that your browser stores credential cookies of domain bank.com which is the website of you bank account, and a hacking website hacking.</description>

      <title>Web Storage Api</title>

      <description>Definition The Web Storage API provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs
Source code These mechanisms are available via the Window.sessionStorage and Window.localStorage properties (to be more precise, the Window object implements the WindowLocalStorage and WindowSessionStorage objects, which the localStorage and sessionStorage properties hang off) â€” invoking one of these will create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed. A different Storage object is used for the sessionStorage and localStorage for each origin â€” they function and are controlled separately.</description>

      <description>What is cookie An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user&amp;rsquo;s web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browserâ€”keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.</description>
