      <description>Main Lesson # Java threads are crucial for executing multiple tasks concurrently in a program. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into this topic:&#xA;What is a Thread in Java? ðŸ§µ&#xA;In Java, a thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Think of it like a worker who performs a part of a larger task. Creating a Thread ðŸ’»&#xA;There are two ways to create a thread: By extending the Thread class.</description>

      <description>What Is Asymmetric Encryption? # Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, is a method of encrypting data that involves two separate keys: a public key and a private key. These keys are mathematically linked but not identical, hence the term &amp;ldquo;asymmetric.&amp;rdquo; This method provides a secure way of encrypting and decrypting information, and it&amp;rsquo;s widely used in various forms of digital communication and security protocols&#xA;How Does It Work?</description>

      <description>Introduction # Java ByteBuffer is a class in Java&amp;rsquo;s java.nio package. It&amp;rsquo;s used for reading and writing data to and from buffers efficiently. Buffers are blocks of memory that can store data temporarily. ByteBuffer is particularly useful when dealing with I/O operations and for high-performance applications. ðŸ“˜&#xA;ByteBuffer can be used in two modes:&#xA;Read Mode: You can read data from the buffer. ðŸ’¡ Write Mode: You can write data to the buffer.</description>

This means all I/O operations of a Channel are always executed by the same thread, ensuring thread safety and consistency.</description>

      <description>Six Java Thread States # NEW State:&#xA;When you create an instance of a Thread class (or a class that extends Thread), the thread is in the New state. At this point, the thread is not yet running. Example: Thread t = new Thread(); RUNNABLE State:&#xA;When you invoke the start() method, the thread moves to the RUNNABLE state In a typical implementation, a Java thread in the RUNNABLE state corresponds to an OS thread that is eligible for running A RUNNABLE state means the thread is either running on the CPU or waiting for Scheduler to allocate CPU resource BLOCKED State:</description>

      <description>Thread Interference # Imagine you have an object that maintains a hit count for a website. If two threads increment the hit counter at the same time, they might read the same value, say 100. Both threads then increment it and set it back to the object. The result should be 102 hits, but because there was no synchronization, you only get 101 - one hit is lost. This is a simple example of a race condition.</description>

      <description>In our previous posts of using Selector for connection and communication (read/write) between server and clients, we only utilize only one thread. Multiplexing is highly efficient, but some time-consumed tasks would affect the overall performance.&#xA;In this post, I will mimic some functions from Netty which allocates tasks to different threads to improve the performance&#xA;Component # We will focus on the components in the server side&#xA;Boss # Boss runs under one thread Boss maintains one selector which only listens to ACCEPT events, in other words, boss is only responsible to accept client connections Worker # Worker runs in a separate thread Each worker has one selector which listens to READ and WRITE events After client&amp;rsquo;s connection, the newly created SocketChannel will be registered with one worker Architecture # Connect</description>
