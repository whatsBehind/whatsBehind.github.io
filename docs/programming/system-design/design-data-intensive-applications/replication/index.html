Replication means keeping a copy of the same data on multiple machines that are connected via a network.

  Advantages of Replication
  #


Reduce Latency: To keep data geographically close to your users
Increase Availability: To allow the system to continue working even if some of its parts have failed
Increase Read Throughput: To scale out the number of machines that can serve read queries


  Principles of Replication
  #


Data Consistency: Each node that stores a copy of the database is called a replica. Every write to the database needs to be processed by every replica; otherwise, the replicas would no longer contain the same data (Inconsistency).


  Single Leader Mode
  #

The most common solution for Data Consistency is called leader-based replication (also known as active/passive or master–slave replication)">

  Synchronous Replication

</h3>
<p>The Replication to follower 1 is synchronous: the leader waits until follower 1 has confirmed that it received the write before reporting success to the user, and before making the write visible to other clients.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage</strong>: The follower is guaranteed to have an up-to-date copy of the data that is consistent with the leader. When the leader node fails suddenly, we are sure that the latest data is available on the follower</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantage</strong>: If the synchronous follower doesn&rsquo;t respond for whatever reason, the leader has to block all writes until the follower is available again</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="semi-synchronous-replication">
  Semi-Synchronous Replication
  <a class="anchor" href="#semi-synchronous-replication">#</a>
</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s not realistic to make all followers synchronous because any one node outage would cause the whole system to halt. Sometimes you make one follower synchronous and the others asynchronous. If the synchronous node fails, one of the asynchronous node is made synchronous. That ensures at least two nodes (the leader and the synchronous nodes) have update-to-date data. The configuration is sometimes called <em><strong>semi-synchronous</strong></em></p>

<p>The Replication to follower 2 is asynchronous: the leader sends the message, but doesn’t wait for a response from the follower</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Advantage</strong>: The system can continue to work (allow writes) even though all followers have failed and fallen behind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disadvantage</strong>: If the leader node fails and is not recoverable, any writes that have not yet replicated to followers are lost. This means that a write is not guaranteed to be durable</p>

<h4 id="things-can-go-wrong">
  Things can go wrong
  <a class="anchor" href="#things-can-go-wrong">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If asynchronous replication is used, new leader may not have all writes from the old leader before it failed. If the old leader rejoins, what should happen to those writes? It is hard to merge them into new leader because it may have received and processed conflicting writes. For example, new entries whose key was auto-incremented were inserted to the old leader database, and insertions were not received by the new leader, so when new entries are inserted to the new leader database, same keys would be used. The most common solution is to discard the conflicting and not synchronized data changes which compromises system durability, and it is dangerous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Split brain</strong>: two nodes both believe that they are the leader. If both nodes accept writes and there is no process to resolve conflict, data is likely to be lost or corrupted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Timeout trade-offs</strong>: A longer timeout means a longer time to recover in case the leader fails. Too short timeout may cause unnecessary failover. A temporary load spike or a network glitch could cause a node&rsquo;s slow response</p>

  Statement-Based Replication

</h3>
<p>The leader logs every write request (statement) that it executes and sends that statement log to its followers. <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> statements for a relational database</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: Nondeterministic functions, like <code>NOW()</code> or <code>RAND()</code> are likely to generate different values in each replica</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="write-ahead-log-wal-shipping">
  Write-Ahead Log (WAL) shipping
  <a class="anchor" href="#write-ahead-log-wal-shipping">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Storage engines usually append every write to a log. For example in B-Trees, every modification is written to a write-ahead log (WAL). The database then applies the operation from WAL to the B-Tree structure database. That ensures durability: changes are recoverable in case of a crash</p>
<p>The log is an append-only sequence of bytes containing all writes to the database. Besides writing the log to disk, the leader can also send the log to followers. When followers apply the log, it builds a copy of exact data structure as found on the leader</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Shortage</strong>: Backward compatible</p>
<p>For WAL, the storage engine needs an internal conversion from the log to the actual modification of the database. The conversion process may not be backward compatible, in other words, different versions of storage engine may convert same log to different data changes on the database. If leader and followers are using different versions of software after maintenance, that may cause problem</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="logical-row-based-log-replication">
  Logical (row-based) log replication
  <a class="anchor" href="#logical-row-based-log-replication">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Logical log represents the data change of a write operation. Use relational database as example:</p>
<ul>
<li>For an inserted row: the log contains new values of all columns</li>
<li>For a deleted row: the log contains all necessary information &ndash; for example, primary key &ndash; to identify the deleted row</li>
<li>For an updated row: the log contains enough information to identify the updated row, and new values of all columns or columns that have been modified</li>
</ul>
<p>A transaction that modifies several rows generates several such log records, followed by a record indicating that the transaction was committed.</p>
<p>Logical log contains information of data that has been changed, so this technique is called <em><strong>change data capture</strong></em>. The <strong>advantage</strong> of logical log is that it is decoupled from the storage engine, so it&rsquo;s more easy to keep it backward compatible. Also, it is easy for external applications to parse</p>
<h2 id="replication-lag">
  Replication Lag

<p>Replication lag is the delay between a write happening on the leader and being reflected on a follower</p>
<h3 id="problem-of-replication-lag">
  Problem of Replication Lag
  <a class="anchor" href="#problem-of-replication-lag">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Leader based replication allows all writes go through a single node and clients can read from any nodes in the system. If workloads in your application consist of mostly reads and only small percentage of write, then this is an attractive option. You can simply add more followers to server more reads (Scalability) w/o increasing latency.</p>
<p>In that case, it is not realistic to use synchronous replication because any node of failure can make the entire system unavailable for writing. Hence, the majority of followers should be asynchronous. That brings another problem, some followers that have fallen behind the leader (large replication lag) would respond inconsistent values to clients. If you stop writes, after some time, those followers would catch up leader. That is called eventually consistent.</p>

<p>This is a guarantee that user would always see any updates they submitted, but it doesn&rsquo;t make any promise about others</p>
<p><strong>How to achieve?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read from leader for data that can only be modified by the user, like user&rsquo;s profile, or user&rsquo;s posts. If most things in the application are potentially modified by the user, that approach won&rsquo;t work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client can remember the timestamp for its most recent write. If the replica is not up-to-date, the query can be handled by another replica or wait until the replica has caught up. The timestamp could be logical, like log sequence number or version of the queried entry</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem of multiple devices read-your-write</strong></p>
<p>Approaches that require remembering the timestamp are more difficulty because one device doesn&rsquo;t know the updates made on other devices. Some possible solutions:</p>

<p>User can read things moving backward in time. That can happen when user first read from replica with little lag and then read from replica with greater lag</p>

<p>The first query returns a comment that was recently added by user 1234, but the second query doesn’t return anything because the lagging follower has not yet picked up that write</p>

<p><strong>Comparison between single-leader and multiple-leader configuration in a multiple-datacenter deployment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Performance</p>
<p>In a single-leader configuration, every write must go over the internet to the datacenter with the leader. That can add significant latency to writes from other datacenters</p>
<p>In a multiple-leader configuration, every write can be processed in the local datacenter and asynchronously replicated to other data centers. The inner-datacenter delay is hidden from users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tolerance of datacenter outage</p>
<p>In a single-leader configuration, if the datacenter with the leader fails, failover can promote follower from other datacenters to be the new leader</p>
<p>In a multiple-leader configuration, every datacenter works independently. If one datacenter fails, traffic can be handled by other datacenters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tolerance of network outage</p>
<p>Writes from other datacenters need to go through the public network and to be handled by the leader synchronously. Thus, A single-leader configuration is very sensitive to the problem of inter-datacenter network, which may be less reliable than local datacenter network</p>
<p>A multiple-leader configuration with asynchronous replication tolerates network problem better. A temporary network issue won&rsquo;t affect writes to be processed</p>

<p>At an architectural point of view. The setup is same as multiple-leader configuration. The device is a &ldquo;datacenter&rdquo;, and the network between datacenters is not reliable (devices could be offline). Clients can still write to the datacenter when network outage happens</p>

<p>Real-time collaborative editing applications, like Google Docs, allow users to update same document simultaneously. It&rsquo;s not a real multiple-leader datacenter problem, but they have a lot of commons</p>
<p>One way to achieve collaborative editing is to lock the document when any user is editing the file. Other users can only edit the file when previous user commits the change and the lock is released. This setup is like one-leader configuration, and only one client can write the database simultaneously</p>

<p>The biggest problem with multi-leader replication is that write conflicts. For example, a document is edited by two users simultaneously on Google Drive. User one changes the title from A to B, and user two changes the title from A to C. Each user&rsquo;s changes is processed by its local leader. However, when the changes are asynchronously replicated, a conflict is detected</p>

<p>You can configure replication between datacenters synchronous &ndash; i.e., wait for the write to be replicated to all replicas before telling the user the write was successful. However, by doing so, you will lose the main advantage of multiple-leader replication: allow each replica to accept writes independently</p>

<p>You can force all writes to a record are processed by one leader, so the write conflict won&rsquo;t occur.</p>
<p>For example, in applications that user can edit their own data, like user profiles, you can ensure that requests from a specific user are always routed to the leader in same datacenter for reads and writes. From user&rsquo;s perspective, the configuration is single-leader</p>
<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>
<p>This approach won&rsquo;t work if the datacenter accepting writes fails and all requests are re-routed to other datacenters, or user has moved to a location which is closer to another datacenter</p>

When multiple writes are replicated to followers, the last write should have the final value.

<li>Problem: A single node failure can interrupt the flow of replication. For example, the write flow is A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; A, if node C fails, then writes from node A and B can&rsquo;t be propagated to node D</li>

<p>In the <a href="#writing-to-the-database-when-one-node-is-down">example</a> (writing to the database when one node is down), if we know that every successful write is guaranteed to be present on at least two out of three replicas, that means at most one replica can be stale.

If the third replica is down or slow to respond, reads can nevertheless continue returning an up-to-date value.</p>
<p><strong>General condition</strong></p>
<p>If there are n replicas, every write must be confirmed by w nodes to be considered successful, and we must query at least r nodes for each read. (In our example, n = 3, w = 2, r = 2.) As long as <em><strong>w + r &gt; n</strong></em>, we expect to get an up-to-date value when reading, because at least one of the r nodes we’re reading from must be up-to-date.

<p>Normally, reads and writes are always sent to all n replicas in parallel. The parameters w and r determine how many nodes we wait for—i.e., how many of the n nodes need to report success before we consider the read or write to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<p>When the quorum condition is fulfilled, you always expect to read the most up-to-date data. That is the case because the set of nodes to which you have written and the set of node from which you have read must overlap. However, even with w + r &gt; n, there are likely to be edge cases where stale values are returned.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sloppy quorum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concurrent read and write, the new value haven&rsquo;t been reflected on some replicas</p>
<p>Consider a system with 5 replicas, with a write quorum of 3 and a read quorum of 3. Imagine a scenario where a write operation updates replicas 1, 2 and 3, and a read operation queries replica 3, 4, and 5. If replica 3 has not yet finished updating while it is queried, it might still return the stale value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a node carrying a new value fails, and its data is restored from a replica carrying an old value, the number of replicas carrying the new value may fall below w</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A write succeeded on fewer than w nodes, and the write is not rolled back on those succeeded replicas. That means the write is reported as failed, but the consequent read may return the new value (Old value is supposed to be returned because the new value is from a failed write)</p>
</li>
</ul>

  Sloppy Quorum &amp; Hinted Handoff
  <a class="anchor" href="#sloppy-quorum--hinted-handoff">#</a>
</h3>
<p>For some quorum configurations, there are some designated nodes to accept writes for a specific key. If some designated node fail, sloppy quorum allows other nodes to accept those writes and respond success to clients. When the failed designated nodes are available, values updated will be transferred from sloppy replicas to the designated replicas. This is call *<strong>hinted handoff</strong></p>
<p>Although condition <em><strong>w + r &gt; n</strong></em> is still fulfilled in sloppy quorum, in some cases, stale values will be returned to clients. For example, a read operation happens before hinted handoff completes, and it contacts a set of nodes that don&rsquo;t have the new value. Thus, sloppy quorum achieves high availability, which allows client to write when some designated nodes fail, by compromising consistency (eventual consistency)</p>
<h3 id="concurrent-writes">
  Concurrent Writes
  <a class="anchor" href="#concurrent-writes">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Two clients update the same data with different values concurrently (write #1 and write #2). One node receives two writes in order write #1 and write #2, but another node receives same writes in reverse order. If each node just overwrites the data with latest write, then values of same data in different nodes are inconsistent. In order to become eventually consistent, the replicas should converge to the same value.</p>
<p><strong>Last write wins (discarding concurrent write)</strong></p>
<p>One approach is to declare that each replica only store the most &ldquo;recent&rdquo; value and allow the &ldquo;older&rdquo; values to be overwritten and discarded. Then we need a way of unambiguously determining which write is more &ldquo;recent&rdquo;. We can use timestamp, as long as the two writes don&rsquo;t happen at exactly same time, we can determine which one is more &ldquo;recent&rdquo; even with &ldquo;0.000001s&rdquo; difference in time. However, order in concurrently writes makes no sense, because the two writes don&rsquo;t know and depend on each other.</p>
<p>For example, imagine one item is in the cart of someone&rsquo;s Amazon account. One person increments the number of the item by 1, and at same time another person removes the item from the cart in another device. Two write operations update the item concurrently, and both don&rsquo;t know each other. Then which one should win, 0 or 2? Use timestamp can achieve eventual consistency, but may confuse clients because both writes responded success, but one write is implicitly discarded</p>
